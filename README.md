## Tailwind Notes

I initially tried to use Tailwind 4 but found out that my site was breaking on mobile. After reading through some discussions it seems like the best thing to do is move my Tailwind version back to v3. I "designed" (as much as you can call anything I do "designing") the site using V4 so any magic numbers are probably referencing some value in the Tailwind V4 default theme.
